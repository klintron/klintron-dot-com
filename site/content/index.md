# Character Creation {#character_creation}

## Stats {#stats}

**Hard:** Your ability to impose your will through physical force or intimidation.

**Hot:** You know what hot means. That sizzle of attraction. Burning desire.

**Savvy:** Know how and can do. Savvy is more than just smarts, it&#8217;s about skill and finesse as well. If a GM isn&#8217;t sure what stat to add to a roll, it&#8217;s probably Savvy.

**Weird:** Freakiness. Psychic stuff. Paranormal activity. Mad leaps of imagination. Bizarre insight.

No stat may ever exceed +3 or fall below -2.

## Niches {#niches}

Pick a niche, add +1 to any stat to a maximum of +3, and choose Perks. Only one player character of each niche at a time.

**Brainer:** (Hard: -1, Hot: 0, Savvy: +1, Weird: +2). You&#8217;re a psychic freak. Pick 1: Direct-Brain Whisper Projections (You can attempt to implant commands in people&#8217;s minds when you have physical contact with them) or Brain Scan (You can attempt to read people&#8217;s memories when you have physical contact with them) Then pick 1 more: Whack-Nut (Weird +3), Mind Over Matter (+1 armor), Cult Leader (You start with 1d6 followers).

**Dealer:** (Hard: 0, Hot: 1, Savvy: +2, Weird: -1) You have something other people want. You can control an establishment, such as a restaurant or store, or simply a supply of something important. Plus pick two: Scary Hot (roll Hot when you&#8217;d normally roll Hard), People Who Know People (start with +1 Hx with everyone), Trafficker (You can attempt to have something you need cross your path by coincidence), Posse (You start with 1d6 henchpeople).

**Freelancer:** (Hard: +1, Hot: 0, Savvy: +2, Weird: -1) No one trusts you, but when things need done, they look to you. Pick three: Cold (Only Skinners can take Hx with you after an intimate moment), Network (You have a contact in another community, describe them), Dirt Digger (Take Hx with two people at the end of a session), Mobility (You have a car, motorcycle, RV, or other vehicle), Bruiser (Add +1 to your Hard)

**Gunner:** (Hard: 2, Hot: 1, Savvy: -1, Weird: 0). You have an inexplicably large amount of guns and ammo and you know how to use them. Plus pick two: Bloodcrazed (When you inflict a Condition, your target marks 1 more than usual), Wheels (You have a car, motorcycle, or other vehicle), Killer Reflexes (When you fight nude or nearly nude, you still have +2 Armor), Gentle Giant (You can attempt to heal Conditions, at the risk of taking a Condition yourself on a miss), Gang (You start with 1d6 gang members).

**Mender:** (Hard: 0, Hot: -1, Savvy: +2, Weird: +1) You like to take things apart and put them back together. Cars. Electronics. People. You can attempt to fix gear and clear Conditions. You have a workshop. Plus pick one: Touched by Death (when someone dies around you, add +1 Weird), Transpo (You have a vehicle for hauling bodies and equipment), Psychometry (You can attempt to psychically scan objects but not people).

**Skinner:** (Hard: 0, Hot: 2, Savvy: 0, Weird: 0). Pick 3: Transfixing Gaze (When you make eye contact with someone, neither of you can act until you break your gaze), Infatuating (Start with +1 Hx with all player characters). Arresting performance (When you roll +Hot, your performance counts as an intimate experience and you mark Hx). Breathtaking (+3 Hot).

**Zoner:** (Hard: 1, Hot: -1, Savvy: 0, Weird +2) Who dares to venture into the quarantine zones? You do. You can attempt to navigate the wastes, plus pick two more: Scavenger (You can roll +Savvy to see if you have some particular item. On a 10+ you have it, 7-9, you have something that&#8217;ll do, on a 6- you just sold it), Callous (You always have an extra +1 Armor. This applies protection against non-physical inflictions as well), Haggler (Roll +Weird instead of +Hot on any roll relating to the exchange of goods or services).

**Phoenix:** (Hard: 0, Hot: -1, Savvy: 0, Weird +3). Only a PC who has been Shattered can create a Phoenix (see below). Pick three Perks from any niche other than your previous one. If you&#8217;ve comeback as a Phoenix before, pick only Perks you&#8217;ve never had.

## Gear and Other Crap {#gear_and_other_crap}

Light armor, such as a leather jacket, counts as +1 Armor. Heavy armor, like a bullet proof vest, counts as +2.

Unarmed attackers can inflict one condition. Weapons like knives, blunt objects, and low-caliber weapons inflict 2. Big weapons like shotguns and explosive inflict 3.

Pick whatever makes the most sense for your character to have.

## History {#history}

After everyone picks a niche, take turns introducing your characters to the group. Then work out the connections between the characters. First, ask which character dislikes or distrusts your character and work out the reason with that character&#8217;s player. Your character and that character should take 1 Hx with each other. Then ask which character trusts or admires your character and then work out the reason with that character&#8217;s player. Your character and that character should take 1 Hx with each other.

## Rolling the Dice {#rolling_the_dice}

When you act and the outcome is uncertain, roll 2d6 and add one of your stats. The GM will tell you which one, and will let you know the consequences should your action fail. If the total is 10 or more, then you do it. On a 7-9, you do it but there&#8217;s a complication, catch, or twist. On a 6 or less, you might still do it, but you&#8217;ll face a more serious consequence, such as marking a Condition.

## The Psychic Maelstrom {#the_psychic_maelstrom}

What is the **Psychic Maelstrom**? No one knows, but it&#8217;s everywhere and you can open your mind to it. When you do, roll +Weird and tell the group what the maelstrom is like for you. On a 10 or more, the GM will tell you some useful information about your current situation. On a 7-9, they will give you vague hint. On a 6 or less&#8230; well, it&#8217;s not called a maelstrom for nothing.

GMs may also find it useful to occasionally roll on behalf of the psychic maelstrom itself. High numbers may mean NPCs are in a particularly good mood today, or that the characters will have good luck finding spare parts at the market. Low numbers herald future badness.

## Conditions {#conditions}

When the GM tells you to roll for a condition. The GM will ask you to roll +Armor if the force inflicting the condition is Physical (though even in this case, the condition you&#8217;re asked to mark could be Cognitive). On a 10+, don&#8217;t mark a condition. On a 7-9, mark one condition. On a 6-, mark two conditions.

Cognitive:

  * Deflated

  * Enraged

  * Terrified

  * Delirious

Physical:

  * Exhausted

  * Bruised

  * Wounded

  * Mangled

Player characters suffer a -1 penalty per condition marked until that condition is cleared.

Conditions can be cleared by spending advances. Fixers can attempt to clear conditions, as can Gunners who take the Gentle Giant ability.

If you&#8217;re asked to mark a condition, but already have four conditions marked, you are **Shattered**. When Shattered you lose everything that made you you. If you&#8217;re a Dealer, you lose your establishment. If you&#8217;re a gunner, you lose your guns. Maybe you&#8217;re dead, maybe you&#8217;re permanently retired. Or maybe you come back as a Phoenix. If you do, you can never take any of your old niche&#8217;s Perks again. You also lose all your Hx and Xp.

## Intimacy, Hx, and Xp {#intimacy_hx_and_xp}

When you and another character share an intimate moment, mark **Hx** with that character.

You can spend Hx to add or subtract 1 from that characters roll. You must announce that you&#8217;re helping or interfering before the roll. If you&#8217;re helping and the character misses their roll, you share the consequences of their failure. If you&#8217;re interfering and the player character hits their roll with a 10+, you&#8217;ll face some sort of consequence as well.

When you roll a 6 or less, add 1 **Xp** to your total. When your Xp hits 5, you can choose to clear a condition or add a new special feature. If you have three Perks from your niche, you can add features from other niches as well.
